# learning-spatial

I'm doing tutorials and such.
Aiming to treat this README like a lab notebook.

- Environment setup is different from what we currently have on the server:
  - I'm setting up on R `4.5` with Bioc `3.21`, which is where some of the dependencies need to be (e.g. some of `ggspavis`)
  - We wouldn't get around to running this workshop for a little while, so it's not unreasonable to think we'd bump up at least to there by then
- Completed the OSTA: Visium DLPFC workflow
